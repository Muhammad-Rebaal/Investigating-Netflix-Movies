## Introduction
In this project, we perform a data analysis of Netflix movies using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The goal is to explore patterns and trends in Netflix movie data, specifically focusing on release years, genres, and durations.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [provide the source of your dataset]. It includes information about various Netflix movies, such as release year, genre, and duration.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

**Netflix**! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex your exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. They believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. Using your friends initial research, you'll delve into the Netflix data to see if you can determine whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter and explain some of the contributing factors, if any.

You have been supplied with the dataset `netflix_data.csv` , along with the following table detailing the column names and descriptions:
